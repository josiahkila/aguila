        <h2>Second Decan of the Constellation Aguila</h2>
        <p>
            The second decan of the constellation of Aguila, or the eagle, adds further clarity and certainty to its meaning. This constellation symbolizes the pierced, wounded, and falling eagle, much like the grain of wheat that falls and dies. The main star in the constellation, Al Tair, is of the first magnitude and is used to determine the position of the moon, a symbol of the Church, for the calculation of longitude at sea. In Arabic, its name means "the wounded." The second star is named "the scarlet-colored, covered in blood," and the third star is named "the toru." These names all point to the death of the promised savior.

        <h2>Myths and Biblical Symbolism</h2>
        <p>
            The myths surrounding this eagle vary. Some say it is the form assumed by Jupiter while carrying off Ganymedes, while others describe it as the eagle that brought nectar to Jupiter while he was in hiding. Despite the pagan interpretations, the eagle remains a symbol of Christ in the Bible, as described in Exodus 19:4 and Deuteronomy 32:11-12. The eagle is a royal bird, the natural enemy of the serpent, and is known for its strength, swiftness, and care for its young.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Exodus 19:4</strong> - 'You yourselves have seen what I did to Egypt, and how I carried you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself.'</li>
            <li><strong>Deuteronomy 32:11-12</strong> - 'Like an eagle that stirs up its nest and hovers over its young, that spreads its wings to catch them and carries them aloft. The LORD alone led him; no foreign god was with him.'</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Symbolism and Spiritual Meaning</h2>
        <p>
            In this way, the eagle symbolizes the promised seed of the woman, who was pierced, torn, and bleeding to save those who are begotten in his image. The figure also represents the proud sinner who is pierced by the arrow of God's word and brought to humility and penitence, even to death and despair. Only by conforming to Christ's death can one attain true life.
        </p>
        <h2>Paul's Transformation</h2>
        <p>
            Paul, for example, was once a proud, high-soaring eagle, but when the commandment came, he died to sin and was brought to right life. This is a reminder that until the proud are brought down by the arrow of God's word and conform to Christ's death, they cannot attain true life.
